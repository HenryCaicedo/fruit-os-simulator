# FruitOS Simulator

A retro-inspired clone of the classic **iOS 6** operating sysetem, built with **React**.  
This project recreates the skeuomorphic look of Apple’s old mobile UI, including glossy toggles, rounded list groups, and shiny icon templates.  

So far, the project includes:
- ✅ **Settings App template** (grouped lists, toggles, navigation chevrons)
- ✅ **Reusable App Icon template** (with glossy/shiny finish)

✨ Built for educational and portfolio purposes — not affiliated with Apple.
